When photosynthesis takes place in a leaf oxygen gas is produced and this is released into the air spaces in the leaf. carbon dioxide + water glucose + oxygen When  small  discs  are  cut  from  the  leaf,  the  gases  in  the  air  spaces  in  the  leaf  discs  can  be removed. This allows the leaf discs to sink when they are placed in a liquid. As photosynthesis takes place the leaf discs start to float. The time taken for the leaf discs to float indicates the rate of photosynthesis. Step 1 A student selected two plants, X and Y, which were of the same species but were growing in two different locations. One leaf was removed from plant X and five small discs were cut from the leaf. Each leaf disc was 8 mm in diameter.

Rennin changes the protein in milk so that it can be digested by another enzyme. The action of rennin causes small lumps or clots to form in the milk. An investigation was carried out to find the effect of pH on the activity of the enzyme rennin. Three test-tubes were labelled P, Q and R. A syringe was used to add 5 cm3 of milk to each of these test-tubes. A dropping pipette was used to add two drops of acid to test-tube P. A dropping pipette was used to add two drops of distilled water to test-tube Q. A dropping pipette was used to add two drops of alkali to test-tube R. Another three test-tubes were labelled P1, Q1 and R1. A  clean  syringe  was  used  to  add  1 cm3 test-tubes P1, Q1 and R1. All six test-tubes were placed into a water-bath at 40 °C and left for three minutes. The contents of test-tube P1 were added to test-tube P. The contents of test-tube Q1 were added to test-tube Q. The contents of test-tube R1 were added to test-tube R. Test-tubes P, Q and R were kept in the water-bath and a stop-clock was started. After one minute, test-tube P was removed from the water-bath. It was tipped and rotated as shown in Fig. 1.1. The appearance of the milk was observed, and the stage of clotting was decided by comparing it to the diagrams in Fig. 1.1. of  0.1%  rennin  solution  to  each  of Step 8 Step 9 Step 10 Step 11 milk drains back smoothly from the sides of the test-tube small clots stick to the sides of the test-tube most of the milk is solid and does not pour when the test-tube is tipped stage A no clotting stage B some clotting Fig. 1.1 stage C all clotted Step 12 Step 13 Step 14 Test-tube P was returned to the water-bath. Steps 11 and 12 were repeated for test-tubes Q and R. Steps 11, 12 and 13 were repeated every minute for five minutes. The results are shown in Fig. 1.2. 3 Test-tube P had some clotting at one minute and was all clotted at two minutes.

They were provided with: • • • • four pieces of dry cloth that had been stained with the same food a solution of biological washing powder in a beaker labelled bio a solution of non-biological washing powder in a beaker labelled non-bio distilled water in a beaker labelled water. Step 1  A marker pen was used to divide a white tile into four sections. The four sections were labelled bio, non-bio, water and not washed. Step 2  One piece of stained dry cloth was placed on the not washed section of the white tile. Step 3  One piece of stained dry cloth was placed into each of the solutions labelled bio, non-bio and water. Step 4  One glass rod was used to push the pieces of cloth into the liquid in each beaker. The liquid in each beaker was then stirred for 10 seconds. Step 5  The liquid in each beaker was stirred again, for 10 seconds, after 5, 10 and 15 minutes. Step 6  After 15 minutes each piece of cloth was removed from the liquid and placed on the labelled area of the white tile.

A student investigated the effect of temperature on the rate of respiration in yeast. Step 1 7 cm3 of a yeast suspension was put into a test-tube labelled warm. The test-tube was then placed into a beaker of warm water. The temperature of the water in the beaker was 45 °C. 7 cm3 of a yeast suspension was put into a test-tube labelled cool. The test-tube was then placed into a beaker of cool water. The temperature of the water in the beaker was 20 °C. After three minutes, the student added five drops of methylene blue dye to the yeast suspensions  in  each  of  the  test-tubes.  The  yeast  suspensions  became  blue  in  both test-tubes. A layer of vegetable oil was carefully poured on top of the yeast suspension in each of the test-tubes, as shown in Fig. 1.1.

The blue dye DCPIP can be used to investigate photosynthesis. During photosynthesis the blue colour  of  the  DCPIP  changes  and  eventually  disappears  so  that  it  becomes  colourless.  The remaining mixture appears green due to the chloroplast suspension. A student investigated the effect of light on photosynthesis in a chloroplast suspension. Step 1  The student crushed eight green leaves in an ice-cold buffer solution. Step 2 The mixture of crushed leaves and buffer solution was then filtered to form a chloroplast suspension. The student was given two test-tubes. One test-tube was wrapped in aluminium foil to exclude light. The second test-tube was not covered in foil so that light could reach the contents of this test-tube. A plastic pipette was used to add 2 cm3 of the chloroplast suspension to each of the two test-tubes. A syringe was used to add 5 cm3 of DCPIP solution to both test-tubes. A stopper was placed in each test-tube. Both test-tubes were placed in a water-bath containing ice-cold water. The water-bath was positioned near a bright light.

Cell membranes are partially permeable. Step 1 One test-tube was labelled C and another test-tube was labelled H. The student drew a small X on the outside of each test-tube as shown in Fig. 1.1. C X H X Fig. 1.1 Step 2 The student was given two pieces of dialysis tubing. A knot was tied at one end of each piece of dialysis tubing to form two bags. Step 3 Starch suspension was put into each dialysis tubing bag until each bag was approximately three-quarters full. Step 4 One  of  the  dialysis  tubing  bags  containing  starch  suspension  was  put  into  test-tube C. The open end of the dialysis tubing was folded over the top of the test-tube. It was secured with an elastic band as shown in Fig. 1.2. elastic band CC X open end of the dialysis tubing bag folded over the top of the test-tube dialysis tubing bag containing starch suspension test-tube closed end of the dialysis tubing bag Fig. 1.2 Step 5  Step 4 was repeated with the other dialysis tubing bag and test-tube H.

Many health drinks contain vitamin C. 2 A student estimated the concentration of vitamin C in a health drink by comparing it to solutions with known concentrations of vitamin C. DCPIP is an indicator for vitamin C. When added to a vitamin C solution, the blue DCPIP reacts with vitamin C and becomes colourless. Drops of DCPIP are added to the vitamin C solution until the solution remains blue.
