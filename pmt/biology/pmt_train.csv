4,3,"3  Toads are amphibians. Only two species are native to Britain, the Common toad (Bufo bufo) and the Natterjack toad (Bufo calamita). Natterjack  toads  like  warm  sandy  soil  in  open  and  sunny  habitats,  with  shallow  pools  for breeding.  Examples of these habitats are heathland and sand dunes.

Heathland  can  easily change to woodland as trees grow on it. In the summer, woodland is colder than heathland due to the shade the trees create.

Fig. 5.1 1 2 3 [3] A  study  was  carried  out  in  Sweden  into  the  effects  of  natural  selection  on  wing  length  in reed warblers. The wings of young reed warblers reach their maximum length a few days after leaving the nest. At  this  age  the  wing  length  in  millimetres  of  each  bird  was  recorded.  Each  bird  was identified by putting a small ring around one of its legs. When the birds were caught in net traps as adults, the information on the rings was used to identify specific birds and their ages. The  length  of  time  between  ringing  and  trapping  was  recorded  for  each  bird  that  was identified before it was released. The mean age at trapping was calculated for birds with each wing length. The results are shown in Table 5.1.

4,1,"Red  blood  cells  have  special  molecules  on  their  cell  membranes.  These  are  known  as antigens and they stimulate the production of antibodies. These antigens also determine a person’s blood group. Before carrying out kidney transplants, it is important to check that the blood group of the donor matches the blood group of the recipient. This is called blood typing. It is necessary because blood group antigens are present on the inner lining of blood vessels in the kidney. (b) Explain  what  would  happen  if  a  kidney  from  a  person  with  blood  group  A  was transferred into the body of a person with blood group O. Tissue typing is carried out before transplanting a kidney. This makes sure that there is a close match between the donated kidney and the recipient.  However, it is possible to carry out transplants of the cornea without blood typing or tissue typing.

4,2,"2  Enzymes are biological catalysts. (a) Define the term catalyst. [2] Urease is an enzyme found in bacteria and in the seeds of some species of bean. The enzyme catalyses the reaction: urea + water                    carbon dioxide + ammonia The  production  of  ammonia  increases  the  pH  of  the  area  around  the  bacteria.  The formation of ammonia can be used to study the progress of the reaction by testing the pH of the surrounding medium with a pH indicator, such as Universal Indicator solution. Some students carried out an investigation to find out if there was urease in the seeds of four different species of bean. (cid:127) The germinating seeds were ground up in water and filtered to give an extract containing proteins. (cid:127) Each extract was added to a urea solution and kept at 30 °C for 30 minutes (tubes 1 to 4). (cid:127) Two more tubes (5 and 6) were included in the investigation.

The  kidneys filter the blood and reabsorb the glucose. If  the  blood  contains  more  than  180  mg  of  glucose  per  100  cm3,  the  kidney  cannot reabsorb  it  all  and  some  is  present  in  the  urine.  This  figure  is  called  the  renal threshold. A  doctor  suspects  that  a  patient  has  diabetes  because  a  urine  test  is  positive  for glucose. The patient takes a glucose tolerance test by drinking a solution of glucose. The doctor records the patient’s blood glucose concentration at 30 minute intervals for five and a half hours.
